                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-violet-700">1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
                <p>There are three keywords in JavaScript that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and const.
                    Each keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables they create can be used.
                    <br>
                    <img class="h-[500px] w-full md:w-10/12 lg:w-8/12 px-2" src="./Asset/letVarConst.jpg" alt="">
                    <br>

                    <b>1. let</b>: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to
                    a
                    value.
                    Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
                    usually denoted by curly braces {}. <br>
                    Examples:
                <p class="bg-black text-white pl-10">
                    function add(){ <br>
                    let a = 5; <br>
                    let b =2; <br>
                    let result =a+b; <br>
                    return result;<br>
                    } <br>
                    consol.log(b);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// Create a error
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>2. var</b>: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it
                to a
                value.
                Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in.
                Global variables are available throughout your entire code. <br>
                Examples:
                <p class="bg-black text-white pl-10">
                    {<br>
                    var x = 5; <br>
                    var y = 6; <br>
                    var z = x + y; <br>
                    } <br>
                    consol.log(z);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// 11
                </p><br>

                <b>3. const</b>: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable
                that
                can’t be reassigned.
                Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are
                actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.
                Examples:
                <p class="bg-black text-white pl-10">
                    const y = 6; <br>
                    y = 10; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// Create a error<br>
                </p><br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <!-- Q-2 -->
            <div>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-violet-700">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1> <br>
                <p><b class="text-xl underline italic">Use Cases for Undefined</b>: <br>

                    <b>Variable Initialization</b>: When you declare a variable without assigning an initial value, it
                    is automatically initialized to "undefined." This is common when you plan to assign a value later in
                    the program. <br>

                    <b>Function Parameters</b>: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the
                    missing parameters are automatically set to "undefined." This allows you to handle cases where
                    optional arguments are omitted. <br>

                    <b>Missing Object Properties</b>: When you try to access a property that doesn't exist on an object,
                    the result is "undefined." This can be useful for checking whether a property exists before using
                    it. <br>

                    <b>Implicit Returns</b>: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns
                    "undefined." This can occur if you forget to include a return statement in your function. <br>

                    <b>Scope</b>: Variables declared in a scope but not assigned a value before use will hold the value
                    "undefined." This can help you identify variables that need proper initialization.
                </p> <br>
                <img class="h-[400px] w-full md:w-10/12 lg:w-8/12 px-2" src="./Asset/nullvsundefine.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <p><b class="text-xl underline italic">Use Cases for Null</b>: <br>

                    <b>Explicit Absence</b>: You can assign the value "null" to indicate that a variable or property
                    intentionally has no value. This is often used when you want to explicitly indicate the absence of
                    data. <br>

                    <b>Memory Management</b>: In languages with garbage collection, setting a reference to "null" can
                    help release memory associated with an object that is no longer needed. This can prevent memory
                    leaks and improve performance. <br>

                    <b>Checking for Validity</b>: You might use "null" to indicate that a value is not available or
                    valid. For example, a function that searches for an element in a collection might return "null" if
                    the element is not found. <br>

                    <b>Interacting with APIs</b>: Some APIs or functions might return "null" to indicate errors or
                    absence of data. This can help your code handle different scenarios gracefully. <br>

                    <b>Conditional Logic</b>: You can use "null" in conditional statements to check whether a value
                    exists or not. This can be particularly helpful for input validation.

            <!-- Q-3 -->
            <div>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-violet-700">3.What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
                <p> A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state
                    transfer architectural style. <br><br>

                    To make the API service RESTful, six guiding constraints must be satisfied: <br>

                    <b>Use of a uniform interface (UI)</b>: To have a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints are
                    required to guide the behavior of components. Additionally, resources should be unique so they are
                    identifiable through a single URL. <br>
                    <b>Client-server based</b>: The uniform interface separates user concerns from data storage concerns. The
                    client’s domain concerns UI and request-gathering, while the server’s domain concerns focus on data
                    access, workload management, and security. The separation of client and server enables each to be
                    developed and enhanced independently of the other. <br>
                    <b>Stateless operations</b>: Request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary so
                    that the server can understand and process it accordingly. The server can’t hold any information
                    about the client state. <br>
                    <b>RESTful resource caching</b>: Data within a response to a request must be labeled as cacheable or
                    non-cacheable. <br>
                    <b>Layered system</b>: REST allows for an architecture composed of hierarchical layers. In doing so, each
                    component cannot see beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting. <br>
                    <b>Code on demand</b>: Because REST APIs download and execute code in the form of applets or scripts,
                    there’s more client functionality. Oftentimes, a server will send back a static representation of
                    resources in the form of XML or JSON. Servers can also send executable codes to the client when
                    necessary. <br>
                </p>
